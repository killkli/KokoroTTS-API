# Progress Log for Kokoro TTS API Service

This document tracks the progress made on transforming the Kokoro TTS module into an API service.

## 2024-08-01
- Created project directory `kokoro_api`.
- Created `kokoro_api/docs` directory.
- Created `PLANNING.md` outlining the project plan.
- Created this `PROGRESS.md` file.
- Initialized `uv` and created `pyproject.toml` within `kokoro_api` directory.
- Installed `fastapi` and `uvicorn` using `uv`.
- Created `main.py` with a basic FastAPI application and a root endpoint.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with `kokoro`, `misaki[zh]`, and `soundfile` dependencies.
- **Note**: `espeak-ng` was identified as a system-level dependency and removed from `pyproject.toml`. It will need to be installed separately on the system where the API is deployed.
- Implemented the TTS synthesis endpoint in `main.py`, including model loading on startup and handling speech synthesis requests.
- **Fixed**: Corrected `ImportError` for `TextProcessor` in `main.py` by changing import to `from misaki.text_processor import TextProcessor`.
- **Fixed**: Corrected `ImportError` and instantiation for `TextProcessor` in `main.py` by using `from misaki.zh import ZHG2P` and `from misaki.en import G2P`, and initializing `ZHG2P(en_callable=G2P())`.

**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. Test the API locally to ensure model loading and synthesis work correctly.
2. Add error handling and input validation as needed.
3. Consider adding a Dockerfile for containerization.
